# Score-Tracker
A board game score tracker app for Android.

This is being used to learn about Android development, so expect super-high-quality code here.

Planned features:
- Delete game from list
- Improve game info on list of saved games
- New game from existing (new game keeps game name and players, wipes scores, words, etc.)
- Clear all scores
- Move timer (opens in overlay, tap outside to return to game scoring screen)

Known bugs:
- Newly saved changes in a game don't immediately reflect in the game list, have to leave screen and reenter.
